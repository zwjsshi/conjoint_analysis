# conjoint_analysis

## Use Case
The project aims to design a disposable dinnerware prototype for VerTerra company. Principal methodologies list below:
1. Launch a product survey containing all the features of the product, ranging from product's look and feel (refined, natural, weathered), design (round, square, hexagonal), packaging (plastic-wrapped, carton-box, wrapped-edge), and price ($6, $7, $8)
2. Conduct a conjoint analysis using R to drive valuable insights from the survey data:
    * Find individual and overall part-worth utility of each feature
    * Determine the relative importance of each feature 
    * Utility tradeoff between each feature 
    * Consumer's willingness to pay for each feature 
    * Final prototype of the product in an overall and segmented perspective
